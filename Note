# Using past to estimate elements of the covariance matrix

Issues:

* Adding elements if the covariance matrix is on the logodds scale
  * test
  * works (see past_sigma_2)

Implementation

* Last election before data
* Collapse all poll results to abstention, far left, left, center, right, far right
* Estimate with multinomial model (expensive?)
* election days, very hard prior on election outcome
  * alternative: running the process on the difference from the election outcome, i.e. y ~ MNomial(n, results + theta_t[i] + ...)
* Use polling house deviation from previous election season as prior for next one
* Treat elections as polls

Hypotheses

1. It's the combinations. --> FALSE
2. It's alpha. --> Fixed past vector --> FALSE
3. It's alpha still. --> Taking out alpha fixes it.
  3.1 Putting elections back in. --> Treedepth issues at 50%
  3.2 Tau very unhappy
  3.3 Taking elections back out --> Still treedepth issues.
4. Increasing prior on covariance matrix and taking out tau --> zero treedepth issues
  4.1 Put elections back in (0.02) --> Model works fine with zero issues
  4.2 Decrease standard deviation to 0.01 --> Model works fine with some issues 19%
    4.2.1 0.01 ~ 0.25 of a percentage point
5. Put alpha back in --> Max treedepth
  5.1 Just have one previous election plus the initial one
    5.1.1 If it has something to do with incorrect indexing the error shouldn't occur when incorrect indexing can't happen.
  5.2 Fixed alpha generation in the simulation --> no treedepth issues
    5.2.1 Doing it repeatedly sometimes gives treedepth issues; sigma_alpha does not get recovered properly
  5.3 Trying with NElections_past > 1
6. The connection between blocs and candidates didnt work well --> Current model works well
7. Remove current model, test past model
  7.1 Past model continues to fail recovering sigma_tau and sigma_alpha properly; more data does not seem to immediately help; similar problems with variance terms for covariance matrix
  7.2 Assess tau_past x alpha_past relation as with current polls
  7.3 Sum to zero constraints within pollster implemented
